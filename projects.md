The screen is kept uncluttered by default by applying **Responsible for** filter. You can change the filtering by adding or removing additional filters.

### Search

The search functionality searches thru **ID**, **name**, **external project reference** and **external billing reference**. Make sure you clear any filters before searching otherwise you may not see the results.

> **PLEASE NOTE** that the search will only search thru the active projects. If you need to search for archived projects please switch to the **ARCHIVED PROJECTS** -tab.

### Projects table

Some columns are sortable. Simply click on the table headers to change the sort order.

#### ID

Simply indicates project ID.

#### PRIORITY

If you have an urgent project where you anticipate running out of sample the priority setting is your new friend. The sampling process is always carried out in the priority order. Normally when you do not anticipate any sample shortfalls you can just leave the priority setting to the default of five (5). Maximum priority is 10 so 5 falls in the middle ground as indicated as **dot**. Lower or higher priorities are indicates with **arrow** -icons pointing either up or down. 

> The sampling engine always attempts to complete all projects regardless of the priority setting. The sampling engine uses the priority setting to determine in which order the currently fielding projects get to use any new panelists awailable. All new registerered, uploaded panelists and all panelists that are continuously freed as the business rules exclusions expire are added to the available sample pool.

#### NAME
This is internal project name. This name is never disclosed to the panelists.

#### ERROR INDICATOR
If you see an error indicator on your project something may have gone wrong. Click on the error indicator to see the details. 

> If you clear all the errors the error indicator will disappear but will come back if any consequent sampling errors occur.


#### PROGRESS

Overall progress of the project. 

> Progress is calculated by **completed interviews** / **target completes** * 100%.

#### STATUS

Status can be changed simply by clickin on the **STATUS** indicator on each row.

#### Online
Select **online** to start fielding the project. The project will start fielding automatically at the configured **start date and time**. 

#### Offline
Use the **offline** status to take the project temporarily offline. When in **offline** no new respondents can start the survey, however any interviews in progress are allowed to finish normally. 

#### Closed
Use the **closed** mode to permanently close the study. In **closed** mode anybody currently taking in progress are able to finish normally. 

#### Archived
When project is **archived** no more respondents are allowed to either start or complete.

> **IMPORTANT** You should never archive a project right after closing it as there might be interviews still in progress!

> Sample Ninja will automatically archive any **closed** projects after 1 month. 

#### DASHBOARD

There are TWO dashboards available for each project.

- **Project Dashboard** - Allows the user to explore granular statistics on the activity around that particular project.  
- **Map of Respondents** - Allow the user to see geographic representation of Survey Starts.  

Click on the blue icons on each row to access these features.

#### RESPONSE RATE

Project response rate percentage.

Response rate has a color indicator that can be either **Green, Amber and Red**. The red color indicator is triggered when **Send notification when response rate % falls under** -setting limit has been met in the **PANEL SETTINGS**.

> Response rate is calculated using **completes / invitations * 100%**.

#### INCIDENCE RATE
Displays project's current incidence rate. The indicator is color coded based on difference of the estimated incidence compared and the actual incidence rate. Incidence indicator stays **green** as long as your actual incidence > estimated incidence and gradually goes thru **amber** to **red**. The red status is given based on the incidence rate threshold setup in **the panel settings**.

> Incidence rate is calculated using **completes / (completes + terminated) * 100%**.

#### RATING

This is an average survey rating score on a scale of 1 - 10. Survey ratings are collected at the end of each interview and is voluntary to panelists. The rating functionality is on by default but can be turned off in the **PANEL SETTINGS** if desired.

The rating is color coded and can either be **Green, Amber and Red**. The red color indicator is triggered when **Send notification when survey rating falls under** -setting limit has been met in the **PANEL SETTINGS**.

#### CALENDAR

Indicates when the projects are running. 

> The calender feature is there to help you to spread your panel usage evenly so you don't have periods where you may fall short of sample. Ramming all the projects on the same day can quickly lead into a sample short fall after business rules are applied.

> **IMPORTANT**: Calendar by default displays projects you are responsible for. Remove the **responsible** filter if you want to display all the projects panel wide in the calendar.
