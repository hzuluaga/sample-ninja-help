### Project compensation

Project compensation is automatically inherited from **Sub Panels -> Settings -> Compensation** based on the project LOI (Lenght Of Interview) setting on the **Basic Settings** tab. Because the compensation is based on the selected **Sub Panels** you must defined the project qualifications first.

Use the revenue calculator to apply correct per panelist revenue. You must first enter project costs in the **Basic Settings** -tab.

You may override values on per project basis. Reward and revenue must be entered in **Reward Points**.

> **IMPORTANT!** If you change LOI new values are automatically inserted!

> If you never reward **profile** or **quota** terminated you can turn these fields off in **Sub Panels -> Settings -> Compensation**
