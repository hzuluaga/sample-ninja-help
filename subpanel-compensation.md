### Sub Panel compensation

Enter the default compensation and revenue based on the LOI (Length Of Interview) for this sub panel. The compensation and revenue values must be entered in **Reward Points**. The LOI is entered in minutes.

The compensation table starts with 0 and you can have as many tiers as you like. The system determines correct compensation automatically when you setup new projects. Let's imagine you have defined your compensation table as:

- A) LOI 0 min Reward Completed: 100 Revenue completed: 200 
- B) LOI 5 min Reward Completed: 200 Revenue completed: 300 
- C) LOI 10 min Reward Completed: 300 Revenue completed: 400 
- D) LOI 15 min Reward Completed: 400 Revenue completed: 500 

If project's LOI is set to 12 minutes compensation tier C is used. 
If project's LOI is over 15 the last tier is always used.

> You cannot edit the 0 LOI on the first tier, but you are free to setup as many LOI tiers as you like.

> **TIP** The compensation and revenue can be overwritten in **Project Settings**.

> **TIP** To only show rewards completes, toggle on **Rewards completes only** - this will simplify the compensation grid.
