### Sub Panel compensation

Enter the default compensation and revenue based on the LOI (Length Of Interview) for this sub panel. All values must be entered in **Reward Points**.

The compensation table starts with 0. And you can have as many tiers as you like. The system determines correct compensation automatically when you setup new projects. Let's imagine you have defined your compensation table as:

- A) LOI 0 Reward Completed: 100 Revenue completed: 200 
- B) LOI 5 Reward Completed: 200 Revenue completed: 300 
- C) LOI 10 Reward Completed: 300 Revenue completed: 400 
- D) LOI 15 Reward Completed: 400 Revenue completed: 500 

If project's LOI is set to 12 minutes compensation tier C is used. 
If project's LOI is over 15 the last tier is always used.

> If your sub panel rewards completes only you can use **Rewards completes only** to simplify the compensation table.

> You cannot edit LOI on the first tier, but you are free to setup as many LOI tiers as you like.

> Compensation can be overwritten in each project's settings if desired.
