### Sub Panel compensation

Enter the default compensation based on the LOI (Length Of Interview) for this sub panel.

The compensation table starts with 0. And you can as many tiers as you like. The system determines correct compensation automatically when you setup new projects. For example if you have defined you compensation as:

- A) LOI 0 Reward Completed: 100 Revenue completed: 200 
- B) LOI 5 Reward Completed: 200 Revenue completed: 300 
- C) LOI 10 Reward Completed: 300 Revenue completed: 400 
- D) LOI 15 Reward Completed: 400 Revenue completed: 500 

And your project LOI is set to 12 minutes compensation tier C is used. If your project's LOI is over 15 the last tier is always used.

> You cannot edit LOI on the first tier but you are free to setup as many LOI tiers as you like.

> Compensation can be overwritten in each project if desired.
