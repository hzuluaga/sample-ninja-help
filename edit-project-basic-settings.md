#### ARCHIVED
When project is **ARCHIVED** no more respondents are allowed to either start or complete.

> Sample Ninja will automatically archive any **CLOSED** projects after 1 month. 

#### Target Completes
The total number of survey completes that the project needs to achieve.

> If you need to do a soft launch set the **target number of completes** to the number of soft launch completes you desire along with **end date time** you would like to complete the soft launch by. If you satisfied with the soft launch results simply set a new **Target Completes** and a new **End date and time** to continue sampling with the full audience.

#### Estimated Incidence rate
This is provided for reference purposes and can be left empty. Sample Ninja will send automatic alerts if the estimate incidence rate deviates configured % from the actual incidence rate. 

#### Cost Per Incidence
Enter the **cost per incidence** or **CPI** to your client. The project **total cost** field will be automatically updated based on the entered **CPI** and **Target Completes** or alternatively if you know the project's **Total Cost** enter that to the **Total Cost** field instead. This will automatically calculate **CPI** for you.
