### Sampling priority

Normally you would left this setting to the default of 5. Sample Ninja runs sampling in every 10 to 15 minutes following the sampling priority order. If you have 2 or more projects competing for the same sample you can adjust this setting to prioritize projects of your choosing.

> Please note that other project manager's priority is also taken into the account. You should establish a standard for sampling prioritazations inside your organization. Setting the sampling priority setting to max everytime is not the right way to go.

> Regardless of the priority Sample Ninja attempts to finish each project by the end date by adjusting the invitation rate.
