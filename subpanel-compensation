### Sub Panel compensation

Allows you to define default compensation strategy for your Sub Panel using LOI.

The compensation table starts with 0 and this LOI tier is used till the LOI equals or is higher than the next tier. You cannot edit LOI on the first tier but you are free to setup as many LOI tiers as you like.

> Compensation can be overwritten in each project if desired.
