## Refer a Friend

Refer a Friend lets panelists earn extra rewards for inviting friends to join and complete surveys. You have multiple configuration options in terms of how and when the reward payout takes place. You also have control of who is eligible to refer friends, e.g. you may require at least 30 days of panel membership. To start, click on the **Enabled** -toggle to turn the feature on.

When enabled the **Refer a Friend** feature writes to system variables **REFERRED_COUNT** and **REFERRED_BY**.

### Configuration options:

Consider configuring this feature with some time or action based restrictions to help mitigate potential misuse by professional panelists. 

> A professional panelist is a person who is using dirty tactics in an attempt to earn and cash out maximum rewards. Professionals use any tools available to them; including creating multiple accounts, providing false data in surveys to produce maximum completes or misusing features like **Refer a Friend**. 
 
#### Locale selecton
Select which locale you would like to preview the **Refer a Friend** banner in.

#### Upload background image
The recommended background image size is 900 x 300 pixels. We recommend that you do not place any text directly on your background image, but let **SampleNinja** overlay the text. This is the minimum requirement if your **Sub Panel** is multilingual. **SimpleNinja** overlays the text using the correct **Locale** and **Language**. You can use **PNG** image to achieve transparency and can also use **SVG** images for indefinite scalability as well as sharpness on high resolution screens. 

To upload an alternate image, simply click on the upload icon at the bottom right. You can adjust the margins and force the text elements to appear horizontally in certain areas.

> **IMPORTANT** We recommend using the least amount of spacing and keeping your messaging short. This is to ensure that all the text fits on a mobile phone screen! 

> **NOTE** You cannot have different images for different locales.

#### Editing texts
Simply, click on the text to edit. The text box supports **Markdown**. Use the slider below image to adjust the position of the text box. Similarly, click on the button to customize the text for the current locale.

#### Referee Reward
This is the number of reward points paid to the referee when all the configurable settings below are met. Leave as zero for no compensation.

#### Minimum days as member
Controls the minimum number of days a panelist must be subscribed, before becoming eligible to refer friends. Leave as zero to disable.

#### Number of completed surveys
Controls how many surveys a referred panelist must complete, before the referee earns reward points. Leave as zero for immediate referee payment.

#### Minimum days between referrals
Controls how often an individual can refer friends. Leave as zero for unlimited referrals.

#### Maximum number of friends to refer
This is the number of friends that can be referred at one time. This setting does not control maximum life time referrals.

By default all traffic from confirming the referral is sent to the registration survey. However, if you run your registration survey externally you can define an alternate redirect URL where the referrals are sent.
